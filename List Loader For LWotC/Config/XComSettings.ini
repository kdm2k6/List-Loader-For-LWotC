RealizeSelectedListItemFirst = false			; If true, realizes the selected list item before any other list items.
												; If false, generally speaking, list items are realized from top to bottom
												; regardless of selection.

NumberOfVisibleListItems = 15					; Helps make sure that visible list items are realized before list items
												; which you have to 'scroll' to see. In general, this value should be equal
												; to the number of list items visible within a list; 15 seems about right !

NumberOfListItemsToRealizeBeforeVisible = 15	; The number of list items that have to be realized before any list items
												; are made visible. You will want to set this to 0 if you want a more 
												; 'sequential looking' load. You will want to set this to NumberOfVisibleListItems
												; if you want a more 'pop-in looking' load.
